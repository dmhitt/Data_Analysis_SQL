### Upload the data from CSV files into the database tables

Once your database is up and running do the following analysis:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

## Bonus

Create a jupyter notebook that connects with Employee database and creates two graphs:

 1. Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.

 2. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.
